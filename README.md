Team Name: Team Seek Well

Project: Patient Management System (PMS)

By:
* Satesh Ramnath
* Saddique Shafi
* Kareem Soliman
* Hamza Shahzad

Prerequisites:
* Have Python 3 installed
* Have Oracle MySQL installed
* Have Python/MySQL connector installed
* Have the same hospital database tables (schemas/procedures/triggers)
* Make necessary database configurations in the code (more info below) 

Recommended steps to take to using the software:
* run the signuppage.py file, fill in all textboxes and submit, if you want to signin multiple patients be sure to change the SSN (see below for further info on the functions)
* run admin_doctor_window.py
* press the Show Information button in the Patient information frame
* Before you can show/update info in the other frames, you need to submit (insert) the necessary values (see below for further info on the functions)
* have fun playing around with the software!
* report any bugs/issues/needed improvements etc. 

Significant Project Files:

Button, Frame: Update, Patient Surgeries

Description: takes input from user (patient ssn, surgery id, surgery name, begin date, end date, and results) and makes changes to the inputted attributes (besides ssn), if there are any to be made

* CONSTRAINTS FOR ALL UPDATES: 

You can leave field's you do not desire to update blank. You cannot change the pre-assigned ID's as they are considered as event ID's, except in patient drug treatment where you are allowed to change the diagnosis id that corresponds to a patients drug treatment. 

You need to enter an SSN and valid ID to update, even though a messagebox says you have successfully updated a field if you do not enter an existing SSN/ID, the database made no changes because it did not find an existing value to update. 

* app.py

  Path: CSC-336-Project-1\Databases Project 1\app.py
  
  Description: This is the signin page that can be accessed on a webbrowser.
  
  Necesary Program Changes needed to be made by programmer:

  * Adjust the app.config['MYSQL_DATABASE_USER'], app.config['MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] etc. to your preferred settings/values.
   
  
  *TRIGGERS: 
  
  For every date attribute in this database, there is a trigger that automatically changes the date to the current date if a user  
  attempts to input a future date. This logically makes sense since it would be a corrupt system if you could enter future values.
  
  *3NF:
  
  The ID's in this database are not specific ID's that correspond to a specific drug, diagnosis, surgery, etc. These ID's should be 
  thought of as an "event ID". These ID's are unique and identify the specific event for a specfic patient. 
  
  A Unique constraint was put on (SSN, event name, date) specifically so a user could not enter the same thing on the same day, as it 
  can only logically happen once in a hospital. For example, you aren't prescribed excedrin twice on the same day because you were 
  diagnosed with a headache. This constraint works in such a way that two people can be diagnosed with the same thing on the same day.
  Essentially, values can be repeated, but NOT all at the same time.
